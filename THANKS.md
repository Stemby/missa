missa THANKS file
=================
missa has originally been written by Carlo Stemberger. Many people further
contributed to this class by reporting problems, suggesting various
improvements, providing examples or submitting actual code. It would not be what
it is today without the invaluable help of these people: thank you all!

A special thanks to [OldClaudio](https://www.guitex.org/home/forum/profile/userid-903)
and [Enrico Gregorio](https://www.guitex.org/home/forum/profile/userid-161) for their coding skills freely donated to this cause.
